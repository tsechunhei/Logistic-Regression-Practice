Predict Sales using Price, Urban, and US.
```{r}
library(stargazer)
load("Carseats.rda")

lm1 = lm(Sales ~ Price + as.factor(Urban) + as.factor(US), Carseats)
stargazer(lm1, type='text')
```


Interpretation of each coefficient:
When Price increases by 1 unit, Sales decreases by -0.054. 
When the observation is in urban area, Sales decreases by -0.022.
When the observation is in US, Sales increases by 1.201.


Equation form:
Sales = beta0 + beta1 * Price + beta2 * Urban + beta3 * US + error



Only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with
the outcome:
```{r}
lm2 = lm(Sales ~ Price + as.factor(US), Carseats)
stargazer(lm2, type='text')
```
The two models have the same R-squared and fit the data equally well.

```{r}
confint(lm2)
```
